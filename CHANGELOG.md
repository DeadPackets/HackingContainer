# PwnBox - v3.7.2

It's been a while since an update!

Here's what is new:
- Some bug fixes all over the code
- The image is now squashed to reduce the size
- Replaced CrackMapExec with NetExec
- Added some more AD tools
- Replaced using `setup.py` with `pip install .` on most tools
- Added ARM64 builds!
- Removed RsaCtfTool due to z3-solver taking FOREVER to build on ARM64.
